Pro Sandy Desert Tilemap
--------------------------
Congradulations!  You've purchased this professional graphics package for your games so you can bring them to life in pixel art!

This high quality pixel art asset package contains the following...


5 Tilemaps
-----------
	1) Sand
	This tilemap is your bread and butter; intended for most of the playspace.  
	More detailed than the others, this tilemap contains a full set of sand platform pieces, and a series of dirt pieces to line the inside of the sand and break up all that brown.  
	
	2) Background
	This tilemap is less saturated and dark; intended for the backwall of your playspace.  
	It's best used for caves, as a visual support for otherwise floating platforms, or simply to breakup the background and spark some visual interest.

	3) Cactus
	This tilemap is intended to provide foliage of near infinite variety and scale.  
	As the title implies, it's best used to make cacti. We find they work best to break up the scene in open areas where you don't want to use the Background tilemap.

	4) Hazard
	This tilemap is intended to be spikes, without just being man-made spikes in the middle of a sandy desert.  
	It's best used anywhere you want to make spikey and dangerous.

	5) Detail
	This tilemap is intended for final polish, bringing some spots of color or detail to your level.  
	It's best used once everything else is finished, so you can determine where best to place each piece.


Parallax_Arches Folder
-------------------
When arranged behind their matching parallax backgrounds, these sprites allow you to add large desert rock arches to the background.
	bg_parallax3_arch A, B, and C
	bg_parallax4_arch A, B, and C

Simply place the arches in a layer behind Dune A and Dune B, respectively.


Parallax_Background Folder
--------------------------
When arranged in order, and moved at different speed relative to the camera, these horizontally tiling backgrounds produce a visually professional parallax effect, creating the illusion of depth.
From front to back...
	1) Clouds
	2) Cactus(should be moved at the same speed as layer 3)
	3) Dune A
	4) Dune B
	5) Dune C
	6) Sky
If making multiple levels, the Cactus layer can be hidden to mix up the background more.

Bonus_Sprites Folder
-------------------
Because we can't tell you how much we appreciate you paying for this asset pack, we've included a few bonus sprites to say thank you!
	-Gem
	-Door
	-Switch
For Platformers or Sidescrollers, we figured the most important things to include would be a reward, a door that can be locked or unlocked, and a switch to open the door.
